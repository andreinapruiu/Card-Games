## Now you see me - Homework 1

### Description:

* The theme kind of recreates the "Now you see me" cards game. It even has split, shuffle and merge. It feels really magical.

* The decks are added to a list, every deck being already a list and by using simple commands(such as SHOW_ALL or MERGE_DECKS) the user can simulate the use of real life cards inside the program. The entire program is dinamicly allocated so no worries about memory leaks =)

* I think the code is easy to read and also understand, most of the commands being already named very specific. Only the commands function in the main file is a little hard to digest. Basically, the function uses a line(which contains the command given by the user) to split it into the real command(SHOW_ALL etc.) and parameters(deck_index, card_index etc.). All of this is done for later use as it can be seen in the main function where the commands given by the user are compared (in a switch) with the possible instructions for the decks.
<br>Also, as it is said in the main.c file, where are all the includes it is specified that every file has multiple function in it(very specific like show_deck.h has all the functions that print something)

### Comentarii asupra temei:

* I think that most of my homework can be improved, simple as that. Every work can have more improvements
* I learned that managing my time is the most important part of a task. Most of my work was done in the last minute, so i don't want to repeat this bad practice.
